	<h3> Van-Der-Waals model</h3>
		
The <it>Van-Der-Waals model</it> is possibly the most intuitive of the
availabe models: each atom is drawn as a sphere, with a radius
corresponding to its type.
<br><br>
The computation of the next model, a <it>Solvent Excluded Surface</it>, might
take a moment, depending on the performance of your machine.
