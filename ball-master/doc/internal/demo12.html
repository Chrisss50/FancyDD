	<h3>Coloring by amino acid index</h3>
	
This Cartoon Model has been colored according to the index of 
each amino acid in the polypeptide chain. Since Proteins are linear 
molecules, this yields a nice color interpolation from red at the beginning
of the molecule to blue at its end in the default coloring settings.
<br>
<br>
<b>Due to computational issues we have to skip the energy minimization and the MD Simulation 
	in the RTFact version. Sorry!</b> 
<br>
When you press Next, an <b>energy minimization</b> will start. You can watch 
the molecule's structural changes.
We will perform 20 steps and the current
step number will be shown in the statusbar at the bottom of the main window.
<br><br>
Don't worry if the simulation takes a moment to start.
