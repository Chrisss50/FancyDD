<h3>Changing the Camera Position</h3>
To set the lights as well as to find a proper camera position for the picture, an efficient handling of the camera is needed.<br>
The camera's position can be changed by clicking with a mouse button into the 3D graphics view and dragging the mouse:
<ul>
<li> Left button: Rotate
<li> Middle or Wheel: Zoom
<li> Right button: Move view 
<li> Left and Right button: Rotate in the screen plane
</ul>
Try to zoom very close to the peptide, then very far away, and compare the brightness of the scene of both camera positions.
<br>

<br>
A roughly sensible camera position can be found by centering the camera on the entire peptide:<br>
Find the widget with the name <b>Structures</b> and
highlight the System by clicking on its name ("ARND").<br>
Then, press the right mouse button to open a context menu and press on the
<b>Focus</b> entry.
<br>
<br>
Press <b>Next</b> to continue.
