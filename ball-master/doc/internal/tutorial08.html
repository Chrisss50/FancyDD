<h3>Coloring a SES by electrostatics</h3>

Now we will colorize the SES. 
Find the "Representations" widget and
highlight its representation.<br>
Then press "<b>Modify Representation</b>" in the context menu of the SES.<br>
In the newly opened dialog, select the <b>Color By Grid</b> tab.
<br>
We will now interpolate the colors of the SES
between some selected values. For now the most negative and 
positive values in the grid are used, but you can also change them
to your liking. Just press "<b>OK</b>" and have a look at 
the SES. 
<br><br>
If you want to, you can try some other 
settings and colors before we continue with the tutorial. 
The colors can be changed by clicking on the button "<b>Select</b>".
<br>
<br>
Press Next to continue.
