<blockquote>

   <h3> Visualisation of trajectories </h3>

To visualise the resulting trajectory, we will have a look at the 
DatasetControl. It is one of the listviews in the main window and
has the caption "Datasets". 
(Maybe it is hidden, if you don't find it, have a look at the menu
entry <b>"Windows->Datasets"</b>.)
<br><br>
The DatasetControl should have an entry for the trajectory.
To visualize it, click on the entry and open the context menu with
the right mouse button. First choose "<b>Buffer Trajectory</b>" and then 
"<b>Visualize Trajectory</b>". <br>
In the Snapshot Visualization dialog press "<b>Animate</b>".<br>
Feel free to watch the visualization for as long as you want, you can stop it, by pressing
the "Cancel" button. Then close the visualization dialog by pressing the <b>Close</b> button.
<br>
<br>
Press Next to continue.
