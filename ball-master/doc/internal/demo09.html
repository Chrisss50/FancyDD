	<h3>The Hydrogen Bonds model</h3>

In order to understand a proteins structure, or the structure of a biomolecular
complex, it is often illustrative to look at its <it>hydrogen bonds</it>. 
These can be computed in BALLView as well (<b>Tools->Calculate HBonds</b>), 
and visualized as "dashed" bonds.
