<h3>Setting the Materials</h3>
In addition to the lighting effects, nice effects can be achieved by changing the material settings. 
<br>
<br>
The material settings of a representation can be modified using the <b>Modify Representation</b> dialog. <br>
Open it by pressing the right mouse button in the <b>Representations</b> window on the <b>Ball and Stick</b> representation 
built from the ARND peptide. Choose <b>Modify Representation</b> in the activated context menu.
<br>
<br>
The <b>Renderer</b> box offers to switch between the three current renderes of BALLView.
<ul>
	<li> OpenGL,  
	<li> POVRay, and 
	<li> RTFact.</ul>
Click on <b>RTFact</b> in the radio button list  
and enable the <b>automatic update</b> checkbox.
<br>
The best way to get to know the different material properties is to play with their sliders.
<br>

<h4>Ambient Intensity</h4>
The Ambient Intensity specifies the amount of background light that is unconditionally 
added to the represenation.<br>
Try different Ambient Intensity factor values and compare the change in the 
molecule's appearance.
<br>

<h4>Specularity</h4>
The Specularity determines the intensity of the specular highlights. <br>
Change the Specularity factor to a smaller value and watch the highlights.
<br>

<h4>Shininess</h4>
The Shininess accounts for the size of the specular highlights.<br>
Vary the Shininess factor and compare the highlights on the molecule.
<br>

<h4>Reflectivity</h4>
The Reflectivity is the ability of the representation to reflect light, i.e. to act as a mirror.<br>
In the following, we guide you to change an already added plane into a mirror.<br>  
Open the <b>Modify Representation</b> dialog from the context menu of the 
mirror plane's entry in the <b>Representations</b> window (right click on the entry), 
select the <b>RTFact</b> renderer in the radio button list, 
and enable the <b>automatic update</b> checkbox. <br>
Now, set the <b>Reflectiveness</b> to <b>1</b>. <br>
Close the dialog by pressing <b>OK</b>.<br>
Now, change the camera position to a viewpoint where both, the molecule and its mirror image, can be seen simultaneously.
<br>


<h4>Transparency</h4>
The effect of Transparency can be perfectly demonstrated using a transparent molecular surface.<br>
To this end, build an <b>SES</b> surface of our molecule by opening the context menu of our protein ARND in the <b>Structures</b> window (right click on it) and by selecting <b>Create Representation</b>.
Then choose <b>SES->by element</b>. 
<br>
Open the <b>Modify Representation</b> dialog of the <b>SES</b> surface in the 
<b>Representations</b> window by opening the context menu of <b>SES</b>.<br>
Select the <b>RTFact</b> renderer in the radio button list, 
and enable the <b>automatic update</b> checkbox. <br>
Now, set the Ambient Intensity to <b>0.03</b>, the Reflectiveness to <b>0</b>, 
the Specularity to <b>0.14</b>, the Shininess to <b>6.125</b>, and the
<b>Transparency</b> to <b>55%</b>. <br>
Close the dialog by pressing the <b>OK</b> button. 
<br>
Enjoy the picture!
<br>
<br>
Press <b>Next</b> to continue.
